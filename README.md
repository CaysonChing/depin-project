# DePIN Prototype Project
This repository contains a functional prototype for a Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN). The project enables a shared device economy where individuals can register their hardware to a decentralized network and earn incentives for their contributions.  
  
🚀 **Project Overview**
The core vision of this project is to bridge physical infrastructure with blockchain technology, ensuring transparent device management and automated reward distribution.[1] By leveraging decentralized ledger technology, the project removes central intermediaries and empowers users to monetize their hardware assets directly.  
  
🛠 **Tech Stack**
The project is built using a modern full-stack web3 architecture:  
Blockchain & Smart Contracts (/hardhat)  
Solidity: Core smart contract logic for device registration and reward distribution.  
Hardhat: Development environment for compiling, testing, and deploying contracts.  
OpenZeppelin: Secure standard libraries for access control and tokenized incentives.  
JavaScript/Ethers.js: Scripting for automated deployments and contract testing.  
  
**Frontend Application (/web-app)**  
TypeScript: Ensures type-safety and robust code for complex blockchain interactions.  
React: Component-based UI for building a responsive user dashboard.  
Wagmi & Viem: Lightweight, performant hooks for Ethereum wallet connections and contract calls.  
Tailwind CSS: Modern utility-first styling for a clean, professional interface.    
  
🌟 **Key Features**
Device Onboarding: Seamless registration of physical devices onto the blockchain through a secure smart contract interface.  
Identity Verification: Proof-of-device mechanism to ensure unique and valid hardware participation.  
Incentive Mechanism: Protocol-driven reward system that automates payments based on device uptime or contribution.  
Decentralized Dashboard: A user-facing web app to track device status, earnings, and network participation in real-time.
